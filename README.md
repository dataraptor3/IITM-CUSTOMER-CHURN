<h1>Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company to gain insights and develop strategies for customer retention. The analysis covers various aspects, including data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of predictive models using machine learning techniques.

<h2>Data Exploration and Visualization</h2>
1. Distribution of Internet Service

The bar plot illustrates the distribution of Internet service categories among customers.
Fiber optic appears to be the most common service, providing valuable information for marketing strategies.

<h2>2. Distribution of Tenure</h2>

The histogram displays the distribution of customer tenure.
Most customers have relatively short tenure, with a smaller group having longer tenure.

<h2>3. Tenure vs Monthly Charges</h2>

The scatter plot explores the relationship between customer tenure and monthly charges.
No clear linear relationship is observed, indicating the need for further investigation.

<h2>4. Box Plot: Tenure vs Contract</h2>
The box plot compares the tenure of customers across different contract types.
Two-year contracts generally have a higher median tenure compared to other contract types.
Predictive Modeling

<h2>5. Linear Regression for Monthly Charges Prediction</h2>
A linear regression model was developed to predict monthly charges based on customer tenure.
The root mean square error (RMSE) was used to evaluate the model's performance.

<h2>6. Logistic Regression for Churn Prediction</h2>
Logistic regression models were implemented to predict customer churn.
Confusion matrices were used to assess the accuracy and performance of the models.

<h2>7. Decision Tree for Churn Prediction</h2>
A decision tree model was built to predict churn based on customer tenure.
The model's accuracy was evaluated using a confusion matrix.

<h2>8. Random Forest for Churn Prediction</h2>
A Random Forest model was employed to predict churn using customer tenure and monthly charges.
The model's accuracy was assessed through a confusion matrix.


<h1>Conclusion</h1>
The project provides valuable insights into customer behavior, with a focus on identifying factors influencing churn. The visualizations and predictive models offer a foundation for strategic decision-making to improve customer retention.
